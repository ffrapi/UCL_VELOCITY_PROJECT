#DISCOAL

##OVERVIEW: I'ts a coalescent simulator program capable of simulating models with recombination, selective sweeps, neutral fixation etc

##Downloading discoal: 

##Download all folders from github repository: https://github.com/kr-colab/discoal (Code-Download zip) 
##Unzip folder and access this folder using terminal and cd
##Running discoal: 

./discoal [options]

##Measuring statistics: 
##Download msdir from website: https://uchicago.app.box.com/s/l3e5uf13tikfjm7e1il1eujitlsjdx13 (ms.tar.gz)
##Access this folder using terminal and copy the discoal.exe file from the discoal folder to the msdir folder on your local computer - in this way you can use discoal and ms at the same time to measure summary statistics as discoal does not have such a function.

./ discoal [options] | ./summary_stats.c 
eg: msdir mac$ ./discoal 40 10 100 -t 0.028 | ./sample_stats.c
