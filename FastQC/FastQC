#FastQC - A quality control

#OVERVIEW: FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. 
#It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.
#Can provide a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
The main functions of FastQC are

Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

#INPUT: fastqc.gz files (for all populations)
#OUTPUT: fastqc.html + fastqc.gz
#The HTML file which is saved is a self-contained document with all of the graphs embedded into it, so you can distribute this single file. Alongside the HTML file is a zip file (with the same name as the HTML file, but with .zip added to the end). 
#This file contains the graphs from the report as separate files but also contains data files which are designed to be easily parsed to allow for a more detailed and automated evauation of the raw data on which the QC report is built.

#STEPS (MODC example):
##1: Create 00_fastqc.sh script for each population
##2: Modify input and output in script to the raw_reads directory for each population
##3: Modify -t X (where X should be the number of samples to run FastQC on)
##4: Use "./fast.qc.sh" to get a script to submit to the server 
##5: Submit the produced script using qsub [script]
##6: Check the results by moving the .html files to your local computer

#1:Basic Statistics Structure (Example):
Measure	Value
Filename:	AAg-10-2016-23_L001_R1.fastq.gz (The original filename of the file whcih was analysed)
File type	Conventional base calls (States whether the file contains actual base calls or colorspace data which ahd to be converted to base calls)
Encoding	Sanger / Illumina 1.9 (States which ASCII encoding of quality values was found in this file)
Total Sequences	10087056 (Count of total number of sequences processed)
Sequences flagged as poor quality	0
Sequence length	150 (Provides teh length of the shortest and longest sequence in the set - if all sequences are the same length only one value is reported)
%GC	36 (Overall %GC of all bases in all sequences)

#2: Per Base Sequence Quality
##Shows an overview of the range of quality values across all bases at each position int he file

#3:  Per Sequence Quality Scores:
##allows you to see if a subset of the sequences have low quality values - should represent a small percentage of all the sequences
