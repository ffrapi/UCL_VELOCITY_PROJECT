#FastQC - A quality control

#OVERVIEW: FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. 
#It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.
#Can provide a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
The main functions of FastQC are

Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems
Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application

#INPUT: fastqc.gz files (for all populations)
#OUTPUT: fastqc.html + fastqc.gz
#The HTML file which is saved is a self-contained document with all of the graphs embedded into it, so you can distribute this single file. Alongside the HTML file is a zip file (with the same name as the HTML file, but with .zip added to the end). 
#This file contains the graphs from the report as separate files but also contains data files which are designed to be easily parsed to allow for a more detailed and automated evauation of the raw data on which the QC report is built.

#STEPS (MODC example):
##1: Create Downsampled folders and move all the realn.bam files here
##2: Create modc.names.100, which is basically all realn.bam files repeated 4 times each 
##3: Create modc.prop.downsample.X, where X is the number of samples. This is a file that repeats these four values, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, X times in the file.
##4: Create modc.propnames.X, where X is the number of samples. This is a file that repeats these four values, 0.2X, 0.4X, 0.6X, 0.8X, X times in the file. 
##5: Modify Downsample.sh script - may need to increase RAM and walltime
