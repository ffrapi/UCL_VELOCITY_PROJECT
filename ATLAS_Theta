#Estimating the Theta parameter

#Theta: estimates heterozigosity


#OVERVIEW: https://bitbucket.org/wegmannlab/atlas/wiki/Population%20Genetic%20Parameters%3A%20theta
#This task infers the stationary base frequencies π={πA,πC,πG,πT}, along with the rate of substitutions θ=2Tμ along the genealogy connecting the two alleles of an individual within a genomic window (default=non overlapping windows of 1Mbp). 
#Here, T corresponds to the time to the most recent common ancestor of the two lineages and μ to the mutation rate per base pair per generation. 
#It is not possible to infer T and μ independently, and we therefore only estimate the compound substitution rate θ from the data. 
#To estimate θ, we use Felsenstein’s 1981 model of substitutions.

#OUTPUT: A text file containing the following information/columns: 
#'CHR': Chrosomome (For Aricia agestis the prefix is LR
#'Start' +'end': window start and end
#'Depth': coverage in window
#'fracMissing': proportion of missing data
#'fracTwoOrMore': proportion of sites covered at least twice
#'pi(A)' +pi(C) + pi(G) + pi(T): the nucleotide frequencies
#'Theta_MLE': the maximum likelihood estimate for θ
#'THeta_C95_l+u?': the Fisher confidence intervals for θ
#'LL': the likelihood of the MLE θ estimate
