#TRrimmomatic 


#OVERVIEW: Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina paired-end and single ended data.
#Our data is Paired-end read using HighSeq.
#The selection of trimming steps and their associated parameters are supplied on the command line as you can see in the script
#For manual check: http://www.usadellab.org/cms/uploads/supplementary/Trimmomatic/TrimmomaticManual_V0.32.pdf

##INPUT: fastqc.gz files (for all populations) (the raw reads of each population)
##OUTPUT: 4 fastq.gz files per individual: .R1_paired (Forward paired), .R1_unpaired (Forward unpaired), .R2_paired (reverse paired), .R2_unpaired (reverse unpaired)(For all 3 populations) 
##OUTPUT: a log file for each individual, that contains details about the trimmomatic process and the sequences that were clipped?


#STEPS:
##1: Create directories for each population 01a_Trimmomatic
##2: Modify the script Trimommatic.sh
##3: Generate a submission script by using ./Trimmomatic.sh
##4: Collect information about all populations 

##STEP BY STEP: 
##Create directories: 

mkdir 01a_Trimommatic_mode
mkdir 01a_Trimommatic_modc
mkdir 01a_Trimommatic_mus

##2: Modify the script Trimommatic.sh
#a: Change the input and the output to the 00_raw_reads folder for each population, and the output to the trimmomatic folder

##3: Generate submission script
./01a_Trimmomatic.sh

##4: Generating information 
grep "Both Surviving" 01a_Trimmomatic*/*log |awk '{print $1, $4, $7, $8, $20, $21}' >> TrimmomaticStats.log
#This will write the sample name and number of read pairs surviving trimming to a file called TrimmomaticStats.
