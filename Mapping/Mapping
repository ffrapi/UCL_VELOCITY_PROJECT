#Mapping our sequences to the reference genome

#OVERVIEW: Map museum and modern samples to the Sanger reference genome.
#Reference genomes used: Make sure you're using the latest version of the reference genome. We're using the references from NCBI RefSeq where available. e.g. here
#BWA is a fast short read aligner software, it uses burrows-wheeler transform to perform alignment in a time and memory efficient manner
#It maps low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, in our case our Sanger reference genome for Aricia agestis
#BWA consists of three algorithms, BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM, the first of which is designed for illumina sequence reads up to 1000bp while the latter two are for longer sequences ranging from 70bp to 1Mbp.


#Why is this step needed?
#The goal of mapping is to realign the vast number of reads back to the respective regions it likely originated from. 
#The mapping of the reads to the reference genome typically involves the alignment of millions of short reads to the genome using fast algorithms.

#SOFTWARE: Burrows-Wheeler Aligner
#CITATION: Li H. and Durbin R. (2009) Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Bioinformatics, 25:1754-60. [PMID: 19451168]


#INPUT:  Adapter removal reads, pari1.truncated.gz and pair2.truncated.gz files
#OUTPUT: .bam files


#STEPS: 
#1: Index the reference genome before mapping
#2: Create list of the input names eg mus.tomap
#3: Create output directories
#4: Modify scripts
#5: Index the resulting bam files Li H. and Durbin R. (2009) Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Bioinformatics, 25:1754-60. [PMID: 19451168]
