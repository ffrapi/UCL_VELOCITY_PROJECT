#AdapterRemoval

##OVERVIEW: Used for trimming any remaining adapters and merging reads. 
#Also used for merging overlapping paired-ended reads into longer consensus sequences
https://adapterremoval.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
#AdapterRemoval searches for and removes remnant adapter sequences from High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data and (optionally) trims low quality bases from the 3' end of reads following adapter removal.
#AdapterRemoval removes residual adapter sequences from single-end (SE) or paired-end (PE) FASTQ reads, optionally trimming Ns and low qualities bases and/or collapsing overlapping paired-end mates into one read.
#Low quality reads are filtered based on the resulting length and the number of ambigious nucleotides ('N') present following trimming.

#STEPS:

##1: Create directories for each population 01b_AdapterRemoval
##2: Modify scripts 
##3: Change access of scripts to everyone using chmod
##4: Create the submission scripts using ./
##5: Extract statistics for the shared dataset 





##5: Extracting statistics after AdapterRemoval has succesfully run: 
#Run this in each AdapterRemoval folder
ls *settings |awk -F "." '{print $1}' > names
grep "Total number of read pairs" *settings| awk '{print $6}' > file1
grep "Number of well aligned read pairs" *settings| awk '{print $7}' > file2
grep "Number of reads with adapters" *settings| awk '{print $6}' > file3
grep "full-length collapsed pairs" *settings | awk '{print $6}' > file4
grep "Number of retained reads" *settings| awk '{print $5}' > file5
grep "Average length" *settings| awk '{print $6}' > file6
paste names file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 file6
