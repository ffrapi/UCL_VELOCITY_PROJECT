#Run this in each AdapterRemoval folder
ls *settings |awk -F "." '{print $1}' > names
grep "Total number of read pairs" *settings| awk '{print $6}' > file1
grep "Number of well aligned read pairs" *settings| awk '{print $7}' > file2
grep "Number of reads with adapters" *settings| awk '{print $6}' > file3
grep "full-length collapsed pairs" *settings | awk '{print $6}' > file4
grep "Number of retained reads" *settings| awk '{print $5}' > file5
grep "Average length" *settings| awk '{print $6}' > file6
paste names file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 file6
