#Processing bam files

#4 steps: 
##1: Add Read Group Information
##2: Mark Duplicate Reads
##3: Local Realignment
##4: Validate bam files



##1 Add read group information 


#OVERVIEW: Formulate the read group name based on the population and the sequencing library. 
#Assigns all the reads in a file to a single new read-group.
#Many tools (Picard and GATK for example) require or assume the presence of at least one RG tag, defining a "read-group" to which each read can be assigned (as specified in the RG tag in the SAM record).
#This tool enables the user to assign all the reads in the #INPUT to a single new read-group

#INPUT: .bam files (from mapping step)
#STEPS: .RG files (with the necessary read group information) 

#1: Choose your RGID and RGLB based on the species and population. 
#RGID for aricia agestis modern core, RGID=C3modc, RGID=C3mode, RGID=C3mus
#RGLB for aricia agestis: RGLB=mod02, mus RGLB=mus0204
#2: Modify script accordingly (make sure to add these RGID and RGLB in both places) 



##2: Mark duplicate reads

#OVERVIEW: Sometimes we see duplicate reads in the dataset which originate from the same DNA fragment. 
#We want to filter these out because we assume that all read information is independent.
#Duplicate reads can arise during library prep as PCR duplicates, or during sequencing when the sequencer sees a single sequencing cluster as two clusters (called optical duplicates).

#The MarkDuplicates tool works by comparing sequences in the 5 prime positions of both reads and read-pairs in a SAM/BAM file. An BARCODE_TAG option is available to facilitate duplicate marking using molecular barcodes. 
#After duplicate reads are collected, the tool differentiates the primary and duplicate reads using an algorithm that ranks reads by the sums of their base-quality scores (default method).

#INPUT: RG.bam files
#OUTPUT: rmdup.bam files
#The tool's main output is a new SAM or BAM file, in which duplicates have been identified in the SAM flags field for each read. Duplicates are marked with the hexadecimal value of 0x0400, which corresponds to a decimal value of 1024. 


#3: Local realignment

#OVERVIEW: Useful for optimizing mapping to low compleity or repeat regions in the genome

#INPUT: rmdup.bam files
#OUPTUT: realn.bam files

#4: Validate sam
#OVERVIEW: Tool to check that ourr sequences are looking as we expected tehm to. This tool reports on the validity of a SAM or BAM file relative to the SAM format specification. This is useful for troubleshooting errors encountered with other tools that may be caused by improper formatting, faulty alignments, incorrect flag values, etc.
#Maybe in this part write the errors found for each of the sequences for MODE.

#INPUT: RG.bam tools, rmdup.bam, realn.bam
#OUTPUT: .validatesam

#This step should be run for all steps after mapping to ensure that all additional processing steps have succesfully run
