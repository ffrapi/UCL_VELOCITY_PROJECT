Running diploSHIC:

1.	Installing diploSHIC

export PATH=/share/apps/python-3.8.5-shared/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/share/apps/python-3.8.5-shared/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


export PATH=/share/apps/python-3.7.0-shared/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/share/apps/python-3.7.0-shared/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


python3 -m pip install scikit-allel tensorflow keras 


git clone https://github.com/kern-lab/diploSHIC.git
 cd diploSHIC
 
 
scl enable devtoolset-9 bash
source /share/apps/source_files/python/python-3.10.0.source
source /share/apps/source_files/python/python-3.6.9.source
python3 -m pip install --user .


mkdir 05_DiploSHIC
#Copy paste all files in the diploshic folder of the cluster:

/SAN/ugi/LepGenomics/Software/diploSHIC/diploshic/diploSHIC – 

#because the makeFeatureVecsForSingleMSdiploid.py has .diplsohic.fvTools instead of .fvTools and error message saying that the modules are not found appears – and are not permitted to change this .py file in the above folder 

diploSHIC=/SAN/ugi/LepGenomics/C3_Aricia_agestis_FP/05_DiploSHIC/diploSHIC
diploSHIC=/SAN/ugi/LepGenomics/C3_Aricia_agestis_FP/diploSHIC/diploSHIC/diploshic/diploSHIC
diploSHIC=/home/fpitsill/diploSHIC/diploshic/diploSHIC

python3 setup.py install –user #run this command within diploSHIC in the shared folder

python3 $diploSHIC -h #(to ensure that it works)


2.	Creating simulations using discoal (will be updated soon)



3.	Generating feature vectors from our simulation data 

A.	Open makeFeatureVecsForSingleMsDiploid.py and change line 5+6+7? from diploshic.msTools to msTools, diploshic.fvTools to fvTools and diploshic.shicstats to shicstats
B.	Run: python3 $diploSHIC fvecSim diploid train/Neut.msOut train/Neut.msOut.diploid.fvec #to ensure that it works – if it works the output will be shown within seconds
C.	Create fvec.test.sh and fvec.train.sh
D.	Create test.msOut (ls test/*msOut > test.msOut) and train.msOut (ls train/*msOut)
E.	Submit scripts to queue



4.	Formatting our training set

#Before formatting the training set, move all the msOut.fvec files created in the previous step to a new folder
Mkdir train_fvec #input directory
Mkdir test_fvec
Mkdir training_sets #output directory
Mkdir testing_Sets 

neutTrainingFileName=train Neut.msOut.diploid.fvec 
softTrainingFilePrefix=train/Soft
hardTrainingFilePrexif= train/Hard
sweepTrainingWindows=5 
linkedTrainingWindows= 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10
outDir=training_sets #mkdir training_sets within 05_Diploshic


#Example from diploSHIC: 
#diploSHIC makeTrainingSets rawFVFiles/neut.msOut.gz.diploid.fvec rawFVFiles/soft \ rawFVFiles/hard 5 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 trainingSets/

Try: 
python3 $diploSHIC makeTrainingSets train_fvec/Neut.msOut.diploid.fvec train_fvec/Soft \ train_fvec/Hard 5 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 training_sets/

python3 $diploSHIC makeTrainingSets test_fvec/Neut.msOut.diploid.fvec test_fvec/Soft \ test_fvec/Hard 5 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10 testing_sets/

#Expected output should be 5 files: hard.fvec  linkedHard.fvec  linkedSoft.fvec  neut.fvec  soft.fvec (3.8-4Mb)
#TimeTaken: Seconds to run




5.	Train model 

#Create output folders for our output 

Mkdir train_mode #output directory

python3 $diploSHIC train training_sets/ testing_sets/ train_mode

File "/share/apps/python-3.8.5-shared/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/initializers/__init__.py", line 85, in populate_deserializable_objects
    generic_utils.populate_dict_with_module_objects(
AttributeError: module 'tensorflow.python.keras.utils.generic_utils' has no attribute 'populate_dict_with_module_objects'

#Again, changes can’t be made due to permission – cluster support was emailed to resolve this problem 

Answer from cluster team: "What this menas is that you would have to change all the import statements in
the diploSHIC.py script from "from keras..." to "from tensorflow.keras..."

However, you shouldn't have to do that, so I would try to build the repo,
following the instructions here:

Hi Frances,

Having had a look at the error messages you sent, there were some technical
issues they raised which made me think I should try building it myself. I
managed to do this successfully, so please try the following commands:

1. git clone https://github.com/kern-lab/diploSHIC.git
2. cd diploSHIC
3. scl enable devtoolset-9 bash
4. source /share/apps/source_files/python/python-3.10.0.source
5. python3 -m pip install --user .

cd /share/apps/source_files/python
What these do:

Once you've cloned the diploSHIC repository and gone into the created
diploSHIC directory (1 and 2), then:

3. This puts a much more up-to-date compiler in your PATH (some of the error
mesages suggested that the default system compiler was too old).
4. This puts python 3.10.0 into your path to use for the build (some of the
error message suggested version mis-matches between some package dependencies
already installed in python 3.8.5 and those that diploSHIC required).
5. Install diploSHIC

When this has completed, you should find diploSHIC in the .local/bin directory
of your home directory.

python3 $diploSHIC train training_sets/ testing_sets/ train_mode --epochs 10


Created all these, went to directory where my directoreis are and error message: 
ImportError: /share/apps/python-3.10.0-shared/lib/python3.10/site-packages/scipy/spatial/transform/rotation.cpython-310-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _PyGen_Send
