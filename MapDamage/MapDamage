#MAP DAMAGE for museum samples

#OVERVIEW: MapDamage2 is a package used to estimate and correct for Cytosine deamination (or any other transition/transversion bias in the data). 
#This is a problem anticipated for ancient DNA, and possibly for museum data.
#mapDamage2 is a computational framework written in Python and R, which tracks and quantifies DNA damage patterns among ancient DNA sequencing reads generated by Next-Generation Sequencing platforms.
